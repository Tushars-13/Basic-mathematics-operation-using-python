# Python Utility Program

This is a Python-based utility program that provides various useful functions for common tasks such as:

- Checking if a year is a leap year
- Performing simple calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Checking if a number is Armstrong, Palindrome, or Perfect
- Calculating the factorial of a number
- Generating Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms
- Checking if a number is prime
- Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of numbers
- Performing number base conversions (binary, decimal, octal, hexadecimal)
- Converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
- Solving quadratic equations
